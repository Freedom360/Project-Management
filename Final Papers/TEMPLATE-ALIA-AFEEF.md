### Introduction  

This paper will serve as an introduction to “Fresh Foods,” an open source project I am proposing. Fresh Foods is a platform that aims to solve two problems with one platform–the excessive food waste issue in the United States and the dearth of resources faced by stretched-thin food banks in the United States. These two problems are of dire importance to solve, and by connecting these two groups, I would aim to resolve this problem. Fresh Foods will serve as an intermediary to connect local grocery stores who experience overstock and food waste and local food banks that are not having their current needs met, either because of lack of donations or increased food pantry shoppers due to inflation and other economic factors. 

This is a problem that would best be solved by creating a platform employing open source principles because it is a nationwide problem. We aim to create a deeper sense of community and nurture close connections between grocery stores and food banks, hopefully creating a greater symbiotic sense of community that could extend beyond the donations facilitated by our platform. Because the mission of our project is so community-oriented, and the issue we aim to solve is at a nationwide scale, I believe that open-source style management is best. 


### Platform Features and Timeline

Developing the Fresh Foods platform to eventually scale up to nationwide implementation is the final long-term goal, and in order to eventually accomplish this I have planned the development of the platform in stages, with each 6 month stage containing different goals. In this section, I will detail the timeline and goals of each phase.

#### Phase One
In the first phase of development, approximately the first 6 months of our project, our goals are to establish our initial group of collaborators as well as develop communication channels for our project. 
We reach out to potential collaborators, interested in helping create and develop this platform. We will initially focus on recruiting collaborators in the Urbana-Champaign community—those who are affiliated with the University and also other individuals in the community who demonstrate interest. 
In this first phase of our project, we will also begin a Discord server to serve as the centralized hub for communication, creating specific channels to organize discussion surrounding particular issues. 

#### Phase Two
This second phase of our project is also set to take approximately 6 months, and we will have worked on Fresh Foods for 12 months at the completion of this phase. Our goals in Phase Two are to create a database of local food pantries and grocers to inquire about their interest in potentially piloting this program and to also publish the initial base platform of Fresh Foods. 
We will have collaborators who are interested in our work, but may have limited coding and web development skills. In order to still involve collaborators of different skill levels, these collaborators with minimal technical skills will first work on creating a database of local grocers and food banks, and then contacting the appropriate persons within those organizations and record their interest. 
The initial plan for the creation of this platform is to roll it out as a pilot program within the Central Illinois area, possibly initially just within Champaign county. In the initial pilot stage of the Fresh Foods platform, we will only include features essential to allow food banks to advertise their needs and a function for grocery stores to assign themselves to a certain product request. The idea for the Fresh Foods platform is based off of wedding or baby shower registry websites, where the food banks will have an aggregated list of all of their different product desires (including details like the quantity of products) similar to how an individual on a registry would add items to a gift/wish list and grocery stores can assign themselves to fulfill either a certain amount of a product needs or fulfill the complete request, similar to how one would fulfill a registry request. The wish list page and fulfillment abilities will be the core of the platform, and the first essential features we implement and will eventually build off of in later stages.
I would like to implement this first stage of the platform as quickly as possible, and focusing on just rolling this out to a smaller initial audience still allows us to evaluate the usability and feedback from our first stage of initial users, while also not overwhelming ourselves with the volume of feedback and troubleshooting that would come with a larger roll out and initial test audience.

#### Phase Three
The third phase of our project is slated to take another 6 months, and at the end of this phase, we will have worked on this project for 18 total months. The main goal of Phase Three will be to build out the platform to be implemented in other regions of the United States as well as react and adapt to any of the feedback we received during the course of our pilot program rollout. 
In the second stage of the platform, I would like to implement the platform beyond our initial, smaller pilot region. In order to execute this, there would have to be additional features built out on the platform. Some features that would be necessary for expansion are tagging features–on each individual food bank’s wish list page, we would include the ability to tag the kinds of products, any affiliations of the food bank, and the geographic region. By adding these different tags, we would allow grocers to filter through the different wish lists and only browse through the food banks whose location is a match and whose product needs are aligned with the excess at the grocery store.

#### Ongoing
Throughout all of these initial phases of our project—and beyond, as we work on this project long-term—we will work on two key goals, one external and one internal. 
On the external side, in order to maintain the utility and relevance of the platform, we want to push out consistent updates and bug fixes to the platform. These will be pushed out on a reliable schedule, so users encountering an issue are reassured by the fact that they know an update and improvement is always on the way.
On the internal side, we want to maintain the connection and respect within our community of collaborators. In order to accomplish this we want to maintain weekly check-ins with collaborators on Discord and monthly video conferences with our senior collaborators and project leadership. We would also implement a Code of Conduct in our community, and routinely evaluate any collaborators that we believe may be in violation of this code.

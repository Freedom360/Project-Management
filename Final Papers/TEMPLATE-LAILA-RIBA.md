#### Introduction
In recent years, technology has revolutionized the way people plan and experience their travels. With the rise of smartphones and the internet, travelers now have access to a wealth of information and resources that can help them plan their trips in a more efficient manner. But with so many different options available, it can still be challenging for travelers to navigate the various travel planning tools and resources available to them. I can definitely attest to this -- I have been trying to plan a trip to Europe with my friends and it's been a total nightmare!
To address this challenge, I decided to envision a hypothetical open source project for a travel planner app. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive tool that provides users with a reliable and customizable way to plan and organize teir travel itineraries. The open source approach to software development is a collaborative model that brings together developers from various backgrounds and expertise to work together on a common goal. The project is open for anyone to contribute, and anyone can use the tool for free. This allows for a greater degree of flexibility, transparency, and innovation, as well as a more inclusive and diverse community of contributors. 
The travel planner app will be designed with several principles in mind, such as accessibility, privacy, integration, and offline functionality. These principles ensure that the app can accommodate the diverse needs of travelers, regardless of their location, budget, or level of technological expertise.
The app will offer a variety of features and functionalities, including the ability to search for and compare flights, accommodations, and activities, as well as to create and save personalized itineraries. The app will also offer real-time updates on travel alerts, weather conditions, and other relevant information, ensuring that travelers are informed and prepared throughout their trip.
This paper will explore the development and implementation of this hypothetical open source project, examining the principles, challenges, and opportunities involved in open source development in the context of travel planning technology. I will dive into the various features and functionalities of the app, as well as the challenges and opportunities involved in open source development. Through this exploration and using the open source principles I learned about in class, I hope to provide insights for developers and travelers who are interested in open source development and technology. Ultimately, I believe that this open source project has the potential to make travel planning more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for travelers around the world!

#### Strategy   

__Code Access__         
As already mentioned, since the app will be developed using open-source software this means that the source code will be available to the public, and anyone can view, modify and contribute to the project. Code access will be available through popular code-sharing platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
This approach will enable developers from around the world to collaborate on the project, contribute new features, report bugs, and provide feedback on the app's functionality. The code will be structured in a way that makes it easy for developers to understand and extend it, even if they are not familiar with the app's architecture. By providing open access to the code, the project will also encourage transparency and foster a sense of community ownership.

__Licensing__
The licensing strategy for the app will be based on the open-source model. The project will use a permissive license, like the MIT license, to allow for maximum flexibility in the use and distribution of the software. The MIT license allows developers to modify and distribute the software without any restrictions, as long as they include a copy of the license in the distributed code. This licensing strategy will also encourage broader adoption of the app, making it available to a wider audience of users and developers. Additionally, it will enable commercial organizations to use the app for their own purposes, with the only requirement being that they acknowledge the project and its contributors in their use of the software.
This strategy will foster a sense of community ownership and encourage collaboration from developers around the world, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive tool for travelers.


#### Community Events   

__Community Meetings__  
Regular community meetings will be an integral part of the open source app. These meetings will provide a forum for project contributors to discuss ongoing development efforts, share ideas, and provide feedback. Meetings will be conducted virtually to accommodate contributors from all over the world, and the schedule will be posted on a project website and shared on social media channels.
The agenda for community meetings will include updates on development progress, discussions on new features or enhancements, and demonstrations of new functionalities. Contributors will also be encouraged to share their experiences with the app and provide feedback on its usability.

__Special Events__
In addition to regular community meetings, the hypothetical open source project will host special events to bring together developers and users. These events could take the form of hackathons, workshops, or webinars, and will be designed to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Hackathons will provide an opportunity for developers to come together and work on specific issues or features for the app. Workshops will be focused on specific topics such as app architecture or UX design. Webinars will be a forum for experts in the travel industry to share insights and best practices with project contributors and users.

Overall, the community events of the app will will foster a sense of community ownership of the project and encourage new contributors to join and participate. By hosting regular meetings and special events, the project will build a strong community of developersand users who are committed to improving the app and making it a useful tool for travelers around the world.


### Sustainability
For me, Python has always been my coding language of choice. It's become a popular programming language in recent years due to its simplicity, versatility, and strong community support, making it an ideal choice for the development of the travel planner app. Python's high readability and compatibility make it easy to maintain, and its large library of resources can easily speed up development.
Python's popularity has also led to a large community of developers, which means that there is a vast pool of resources and support available. The open-source community is constantly improving and updating Python's libraries, frameworks, and tools, making it an excellent choice for sustainable long-term development.
Also, Python's versatility allows it to integrate with other programming languages and technologies seamlessly. This makes it an ideal choice for the travel planner app project, which may require the integration of multiple services and technologies (such as transportation providers and weather updates) to deliver the best user experience.

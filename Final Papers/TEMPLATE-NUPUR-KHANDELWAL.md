## EcoFriendlyMarketplace.com: Connecting Consumers to Sustainable Businesses
Nupur Khandelwal,IS 340 Spring 2023


### Abstract 
In this paper, I will be talking about an open source project that I am interested in developing, which is a website, EcoFriendlyMarketplace.com, to connect consumers to sustainable businesses. I will be going over the background, purpose of the project, open source project management principles applied, development, and where I see this project going in the future. The purpose of this paper is to apply my learnings from IS 340 and project management principles back into this paper into an idea I’m passionate about and explore how I would apply these principles to make my idea stronger.

### Introduction  
EcoFriendlyMarketplace.com aims to connect consumers to sustainable businesses in their area or a specified location. This platform highlights sustainable options and promotes conscious choices for consumers which can help the environment and help consumers support small businesses. The overview of the website will be a homepage with slides that shows products from multiple businesses with different products, gives an overview of them, and guides them to the business they are interested in. There will be many tabs and categories for products such as groceries, beverages, snacks, make up, skincare, gardening, etc. There will be a verification system these businesses will have to go through to be featured on the website and ensure they are not lying about their environmental impact. Additionally, this website will verify if corporations are actually sustainable or if they are greenwashing. It will track big corporations' impact and their future goals to let consumers know if they can trust specific brands who they are already shopping with. This will allow for corporations to be held accountable and possibly be more driven to change their ways and help the environment overall. This project would be beneficial to use open source principals for many reasons. Research has shown that “the open source model provides multiple benefits to teams and organizations, including increased agility and flexibility, better code quality by design, cost-effectiveness, community support, and faster time-to-market for commercial products and services” [1]. Having an open source project will help this website be successful through working with a community to enhance my design. Using open source principles will be useful for this project because there are definitely ideas that I don’t know how to implement such as coding for the website and enhancement features which I can get help through open source principles. Users can have access to my source code, versioning where they can track and compare different versions of my project, and use a technology neutral open source which will make it easier to use this website on different platforms and be able to adjust to future technology changes in the future. 

### Purpose
Currently, an issue this world faces is climate change and increasing negative environmental impact through pollution, waste, and other aspects. One way that humans can help the environment is lowering their impact through purchasing habits which is what my idea focuses on. Corporations produce just about everything we buy, use, and throw away and play an outsized role in driving global climate change. “A recently published report identified that 100 energy companies have been responsible for 71% of all industrial emissions since human-driven climate change was officially recognized” [2]. Data has shown that corporations are heavily responsible for climate change and are contributing to the detriment of the environment. Data has shown that “68% of US executives admit their companies are guilty of greenwashing. And two-thirds of executives globally questioned whether their company's sustainability efforts were genuine” [3]. Greenwashing is a marketing tactic that misleads consumers to believe a company is more sustainable than they are letting on. One way that consumers can help combat this is to decrease their support to big corporations and support local/sustainable businesses who are honest about their carbon footprint. 

EcoFriendlyMarketplace.com will be available to anyone online and businesses who want to be featured on the site have the option to apply and be selected if they meet the criteria. The criteria will be developed with a team of multiple backgrounds and be enhanced as time goes on. The website will be open source so the code can be distributed and modified, gaining insights from more people. I will be working collaboratively as people are available in different places and different times having varied amounts of experience to contribute to this. I believe working with a community will be beneficial for this website as they can provide valuable insights and feedback as well as what consumers would like to see. Communities can also help spread awareness and increase visibility to stakeholders. 

### Targegt audience
The target audience for EcoFriendlyMarketplace.com will be consumers who are interested in reducing their environmental impact and making more eco-conscious purchasing decisions and businesses who want to grow their name. Specifically for consumers, I believe Gen-Z will be more likely to utilize this website as they are more open to helping the planet and making changes but it is still open to anyone who wants to shop sustainably. A McKinsey and Co. study has stated that “A recent study by NielsenIQ found that 78 percent of US consumers say that a sustainable lifestyle is important to them. Yet many CPG executives report that one challenge to their companies’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives is the inability to generate sufficient consumer demand for these products” [4]. This suggests that there is a growing interest in sustainable products and businesses are not meeting this demand. This means there is an opportunity for businesses to deliver this demand but also multiple new businesses who are working towards being eco-friendly. Businesses will get to reach a wider audience and connect to consumers who are interested in their product. This will be able to help support smaller businesses who don’t have a huge budget for marketing and get feedback from these consumers as they leave reviews. There will also be an idea for a chatbox to ensure that the consumers feel heard when they voice comments or concerns. By having this website, this can connect consumers to sustainable businesses that they are interested in and meet their needs. 

### Strategy
The main tools I will be using to build this website are HTML, JavaScript, and CSS I’ll also be using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like VS Code to test and run code and I’m considering using back end languages and databases to store information as well but I believe that will be a longer term implementation. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is useful for making up the content of my website and telling the browser what to show on the site. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be used to make the formatting of the website and design more appealing and add enhanced design elements. JavaScript will be useful for adding interactivity to the website and animations. Using these design tools will enhance the usability of my website overall. Programming languages will also be necessary in the backend for business logic and functionality and I plan to use Ruby for these tasks. In the future I believe a database will also be useful to store the data on the website and be able to manage it and I’ll be able to use MySQL for something like this [5]. An IDE like VS Code is beneficial because of features they offer like code editing automation, syntax highlighting, refactoring support, and more [6]. This will be useful because I am not particularly experienced in these languages and would be able to get additional guidance using an IDE.  In the future, I think I will come across new and advanced technologies that would fit the model of my website more which will require me to stay up to the most recent changes.  

I plan to use GitHub and version control for my website as well. GitHub is a version control system which allows users manage edits to a document shared by many collaborators. This open source platform will allow people to access the code for this product and make their own contributions while being anywhere in the world. GitHub will allow for an easy collaboration and save a backup of my code allowing me to evaluate many possible outcomes for the design of my website and being able to make it into the most successful version. GitHub is also very resourceful because of how easily it tracks changes to code and makes sure that everyone is working towards the same outcome [7]. Working with a community of broad experiences will help me learn from others and make sure my end product takes feedback into consideration, making it stronger. 

To track the progress of my website and the timeline I’ll be using Asana which is a task management software that will allow me to sign a timeline, tasks, and collaborators for my project and make it easy to measure the progress. Asana makes collaboration easier by organizing work in one place and makes the platform easier to share ideas [8]. 

Since this website is for advocacy and informative purposes, my team and I will be doing extensive research on the companies we plan to feature on the website. Additionally, we will have the opportunity for companies and consumers to partner with us and be sponsors to grow businesses and get their brand names to a wider audience. We will require a sustainability report submitted and companies will have to go through third party evaluation systems to be featured. We plan to be transparent on this website and will feature setbacks of companies who are failing to meet environmental standards as well.

## Publishing your final papers.

To publish your final paper, be sure to refresh your repository fork, then fill in the [TEMPLATE.md file](https://github.com/OREL-group/Project-Management/blob/main/Final%20Papers/TEMPLATE.md). Follow the instruction as provided in the template Markdown code and comments. Click on the "raw" button to see the comments and Markdown code. You can create a Github issue to store your images at a stable URL (upload the image into the body of the issue, then copy the URL from the text of the issue), or upload them to the [Final Papers](https://github.com/OREL-group/Project-Management/blob/main/Final%20Papers/) directory. 

Test out formatting of the assignment as you did in Quiz 1. Once completed, change the name of TEMPLATE.md to TEMPLATE-FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME.md (where your name replaces first, last example) and issue a pull request to the main repository.

Papers should be uploaded by May 11 by the end of day in Champaign-Urbana (UTC -5). [Let me know](mailto:balicea@illinois.edu) if you have any questions.

## IS340 Term Paper: Ideation of a Syllabus Resource Center
Dharra Prashaad, Spring 2023, https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-prashaad/

### Introduction    

Being a student at a large university has its benefits and challenges. One of the benefits is that many people have taken the same classes with the same professors over the year. That can be a great source of knowledge when picking out classes for the next semester. One challenge is that due to the size of the university, it is difficult to access that knowledge. Knowing how much a class will cost due to required materials or the assignments a student is likely to face from a class can make planning for classes easier and less stressful. This project centers around creating a platform that combines the UIUC iSchool’s Syllabus Folder shared to students on Box and the UIUC Grade Disparity site (Oliver et al., n.d.). The UIUC Grade Disparity site allows students to see the average GPA of many sections of classes. If there are three different professors that teach, for example, IS 202, they can see the average GPA of all three of those sections (Oliver et al., n.d.). Unfortunately, not all classes or sections are on this site as some are new or have new professors teaching them. The platform this project aims to create would also allow students to share their experiences with classes and share resources by allowing students to comment on classes. This works to mitigate some of the drawbacks of the grade disparity site.

### Purpose    

This project’s purpose is to create a platform that will help students make more informed decisions about the classes they plan to take. By having access to all iSchool syllabuses in one place, students can compare course content and requirements and plan their schedules accordingly. Although the Box folder has all the syllabuses in one place, many times these syllabuses are added late to the folder. Additionally, the Box folder does contain syllabuses from past semesters, but not everyone has access to this folder. Those who are interested in transferring to the iSchool or who are interested in a minor can still see the resources from the project’s site, even though they lack access to the Box folder. Additionally, by being able to see comments and experiences from other students along with the grade disparity information, they can gain insights into the workload, difficulty level, and specific topics of a course before they enroll. This can help them avoid taking classes that may not be a good fit for their academic goals and interests. It may also help them spread out classes that might require more effort or time than others across multiple semesters. It would also help students foresee expenses like required textbooks and spread those expenses across multiple semesters. 

It will be an open-source project as the code will be freely available on GitHub for others to access and remix to their own needs. Open source software is “software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition” (Open Source Initiative, n.d.). This project will utilize an open source copyleft license, which is a “method for making a software program free, while requiring that all modified and extended versions of the program also be free, and released under the same terms and conditions” (Murray, 2020). One specific license that may potentially be utilized is the GNU General Public License v3.0 which is a strong copyleft license that is “conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. Copyright and license notices must be preserved” (GitHub, n.d.). This license allows for commercial use, distribution, modification, patent use, and private use and requires that sources must be disclosed and that a copy of the license and copyright notice must be included in the material. This allows others to use, view, and modify the source code created by this project and requires them to include where the source code came from. Ideally, other schools and colleges utilize this project’s source code. Since this project will solely be focusing on iSchool courses, other colleges within this university can utilize the code for their own purposes too. Another benefit of this project being open source is that it offers an opportunity for students to gain experience without having to apply to a competitive internship or research position that their lack of experience may prevent them from being hired at.

### The Community
  
#### Target Contributors and Users
This project’s target contributors would be iSchool students or those interested in taking iSchool classes, which includes those interested in transferring into the iSchool or those interested in minoring in an iSchool minor. Due to the iSchool’s undergraduate curriculum, knowing some programming is required and knowing more intermediate or advanced programming is encouraged. Additionally, there are iSchool courses about web development. These equip many iSchool students with skills that can be helpful to this project. Many iSchool students also participate in independent or extracurricular programming or development projects. This means that iSchool students are especially well equipped to participate in this project. However, even within the iSchool, programming and development experiences varies. We would create tasks according to this range of knowledge, allowing even those with no experience with programming to contribute. Those who participate in extracurricular projects sometimes aim to pad their resume or portfolio with these projects, others simply find them interesting and want to grow their skills, and many fall under both categories. Therefore, this project would be marketed as a way to improve skills and a way to make themselves more competitive job applicants. Since this is something that would make these students’ lives more convenient, that may serve as additional motivation for them to contribute to the project. The project team would also reach out to professors, especially those who teach programming or development skills, and request they grant extra credit to contributors. The team would explain the benefits of the project as well as the skills utilized or learned in hopes of convincing the professors. However, it is possible that all of them say no, so this would not be an advertised benefit unless professors agreed. The project team would also reach out to the iSchool staff and advisors and request that major contributors to this project be granted practicum experience or credit. In that instance, contributors would have to make large enough contributions that take almost the whole semester to develop. That may mean creating large enhancements (like potentially incorporating a course planner into the project) or major updates. Finally, professors may be considered contributors if they send in their updated syllabuses or offer expertise.

There is an overlap between the predicted contributors and the users of this project. Since many iSchool students have the technical ability and/or a vested interest, those who contribute are likely to use the resource as well. Additionally, even students who do not contribute may use the resource at least once a semester in preparation of registering for iSchool classes, given the project is comprehensive enough at the time of registration preparation. 

#### Welcoming Contributors

Once the project site has been created, the site’s home page would introduce the aims and contents of the project. Until then, contributors can be sourced through word of mouth and can be onboarded by the Project Manager, who will have to create at least a simple GitHub repository (which will be discussed further later). The project site would include the mission statement as well as the resources available for student use on the site. Also included on the home page would be a section that welcomed help. That section would include information on any and all contributions being welcome, no matter the level of experience or skill. It would link to a main page for contributors. This main page would list the benefits of contributing. The page would include a link to a guidance tree (a very simplified version of this can be seen below). The guidance tree would direct potential contributors to information on how they can contribute based on their interests and skills. Additionally, there would be a link to an FAQ and the Slack join link where communications occur. These three items would be highlighted, but there would also be a link to the GitHub repository where all the versions of the site’s code would be visible, along with a project board where issues can be held and categorized, the schedule, and the vocabulary control (a rudimentary example of this can be seen below the guidance tree example). The repository’s “readme” file would include contact information for those filling the current leadership roles within the project along with an onboarding message that directs contributors to relevant next steps. It would also include basic information about the project to help familiarize readers with the project’s aims and background. Additionally, the contributor page on the project site would include a leaderboard for contributors.

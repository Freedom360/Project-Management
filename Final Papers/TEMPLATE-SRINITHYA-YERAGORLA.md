## SkinCares: Open Source Skincare Platform
Sri Nithya Yeragorla, IS 340 SPRING 2023


### Abstract Introduction

#### This paper aims to approach the idea of establishing an open source platform dedicated to skincare and connecting skincare enthusiasts. I will be introducing the concept with some background knowledge, the purpose and goals, potential platform tools, the working open, the community, and the timeline. The purpose of this paper is to take my knowledge of project management and open source principles learned from IS 340 and apply it to skincare, which is one of my passions. 


### Introduction

#### In the past few years the skincare industry and market have been exponentially growing - the global skincare market is projected to grow from $100.13 billion in 2021 to $145.82 billion in 2028 at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.52%. In the past year itself, skincare product sales grew by 13% (Fortune Business Insights, 2021).  As you can see this market is very successful due to a variety of reasons. The biggest reason being society becoming more health conscious and reliant on social media/technology. Technology especially plays a big part in this phenomenon. It allows consumers to “discover beauty, share it and shop it” (Automat, 2021). Because skincare has become such a staple in people’s everyday lives, consumers are always looking for information about products and how to better their skincare regimen. This is where the idea of open source comes in. An open source platform dedicated to skincare offers an innovative solution that allows individuals to come together and share their experiences and knowledge on skincare products, routines, and journeys. This platform would benefit skincare enthusiasts by allowing them to have access to free information, catered recommendations, and the support of a like-minded community all from fellow enthusiasts. This platform being open source would allow everyone to input their knowledge and allow for improvements to be continuously made, so it can be a resource for skincare enthusiasts for years to come which judging by the projected market is a viable option.

### Purpose and Goals       

#### As I mentioned before the purpose of this open source platform is to establish a community for skincare enthusiasts to collaborate. The goals I envision for this platform are creating a space where people can discuss their experiences with skincare products, fostering an inclusive community, educating others, creating an open source platform that is easily accessible and understandable to everyone, and eventually developing the platform where is can help people craft skincare regimen based on their skincare concerns. The first goal of creating a platform for discussions means users can share their skincare routines, discuss what products they like/don’t like, talk about their skincare journey, and ask questions to gain more information about skincare. This is important because skincare products affect everyone differently. It would be very beneficial to get authentic feedback from people about their experiences - different from advertised experiences by brands who rarely show the true struggles. Another goal would be to educate others about these products because a lot of skincare products have chemicals that can cause harm if used incorrectly. It is common for a lot of the routines to be perfected through trial and error but that usually comes with pain because skin is so sensitive, so educating others about ingredient awareness and the proper ways of usage for some of these products would be very beneficial. I experience this in my own life as well so I know how important this is. I started skincare before it became mainstream so I went through much trial and error, to the point where my skin was peeling and even water would burn my skin. I found that the product I was using had to be used in a particular way, after I started doing that my experience tremendously improved. I know how easy it is for someone that can be in my position to make the same mistakes I did, so educating them would tremendously help because I wish there was someone who told me. As I mentioned before, the end goal of this platform would be to collect enough information to be able to provide personalized recommendations based on concerns which I will be talking about later in this paper. Most importantly of all, the goal of this platform is to foster an inclusive community among these skincare enthusiasts. I believe this is incredibly important because according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AAD), many people with ongoing breakouts say that this skin condition impacts their mental health, which anyone who has experienced a skin condition knows is 100% true (IT Cosmetics Pro Beauty, 2022). The societal standards regarding skin is having even, unblemished, glowing skin, which can be hard to achieve considering acne can affect 50 million Americans annually and around 9.4% of the entire world population which is around 733.2 million - that's a lot of people (Tan, J. K., & Bhate, K., 2015) Even though the numbers are very high, this high standard still exists, creating stigma, which can be hard to deal with especially because acne usually affects young adults typically age 12-24, a period where we are most susceptible (American Academy of Dermatology. (n.d.)) So having a space where others have the same struggles as you and know how you feel can help one’s mental health. Overall, I believe this open source skincare platform has many purposes with truly achievable goals that can benefit many people worldwide.

### Target Audience 

#### The target audience for this platform would ideally be anyone with an interest in skin care since people who experience skin problems can be any age and come from any demographic. Though, to be more specific, considering economic status (having the monetary funds to invest in products) and interest (caring about appearances) the age group between 18 and 24 is the one that buys the most skin care products, being in the 82nd percentile, and also mainly consisting of women (Djordjevic, M., 2023). So it seems that this platform would reach the attention and pique the interest of women ranging from ages 18 to 24.

### Platform Tools 

#### I think the most ideal way to organize this platform is to model it after pre existing platforms such as Discord and Reddit due their collaborative and organized structures. Like these two platforms I want to have separate sections where the user can find a group regarding their main concern which can be separated by skin care concern (acne, discoloration, redness, etc), beginners skincare, skincare brands (CeraVe, La Roche-Posay, Drunk Elephant. etc.), ingredients (Niacinamide, Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid, etc.), skin type (oily, dry, or combination skin) trending on social media, and so many more distinctions that can continue to be added due to the open source nature of this platform. I also want there to be a portion where the users can leave product reviews about the products in their skincare regimen describing their skin issue, what they liked/disliked, where they purchased it, who they recommend it to, etc. I think implementing a discussion forum could also be beneficial where people can just ask questions to get advice and education. Most importantly of all, I want there to be a mental health section where you can talk about your mental health with people who actually understand and get advice on how to keep going on your skincare journey without getting discouraged because it can be a hard and long process. In the future, as the platform progresses I think it would be very beneficial to implement Artificial Intelligence in the form of chat bots. These chatbots would be the first thing you encounter when entering the platform, it can ask you what you are looking for and direct you to it, taking away the process of having to look through the entire platform to find what you are looking for. Over time the chatbot can also utilize the data the user provides to start recommending products they think they would like. You should also be able to create a skincare profile consisting of the following information: age, gender, skin type, skin concern, etc. This would just give the platform/chat bots more data to be able to provide the best recommendations. There are many tools to add to this platform to make it easy to use and beneficial, but these are just a few.

### Working Open 

#### Choosing a license for this open source platform is incredibly important because it determines how the platform can be distributed, used, and modified. There are many licenses out there but the most appealing for this platform seems to be the Apache license. The Apache license is fit for many reasons, but mainly for being easy to work with but having slightly more strict regulations than say the MIT or the BSD licenses. When you use the Apache license, developers must make known major code changes which are key differentiators between the Apache license and the others. I think this is beneficial because while it is good for everyone to be able to access and alter the code it is beneficial to know what was altered and have access to the previous code in case something isn’t implemented right. The Apache license also has more legal accountability then other licenses which is highly recommended because it will protect users from legal liability regarding their usage, modification, and distribution of the platform. It is also important to consider that the “Apache name alone can give potential users confidence in the open source software because the foundation has been prominent in the industry for decades” (Snyk, 2022). Having an established reputation eases potential users’ worries about contributing to the platform and encourages more interaction. 

### Community 

#### In terms of community as I have mentioned before one of my main goals is to make users feel comfortable and have the platform to be a safe space. To make this happen I think it is important to establish a code of conduct. The code of conduct should cover the topics of inclusivity, respect, empathy, accountability, and privacy. In terms of inclusivity, everyone should be welcome regardless of race, gender, status. This leads into the next rule of respect. The users have to respect everyone on the platform; this means no personal attacks, insults, or harassments. Next is empathy; all users must try to understand what others are going through in terms of their skincare journey or just life in general and try their best to support them even if their own experiences and perspectives are different. Then we talk about accountability; all users should be held accountable for their actions and their impact on others. If you violate the code of conduct you will be contacted and the user can be suspended or entirely banned. Most importantly of all, privacy should be maintained. A lot of the users could be sharing personal information regarding their life and health and members should respect that and not share personal information without approved consent. This code of conduct helps establish and maintain a healthy and inclusive environment on the platform.

### Timeline 

#### To actually establish this platform a lot of work needs to be done. My proposed timeline will dive deep into detailed phases and the goals that should be achieved during them. The first phase would be the initial planning and research phase that usually takes around a month. As the word suggests, the research phase is just gathering information and data regarding skincare by analyzing existing skincare platforms/communities, finding the target audience and identifying their needs and starting to develop a plan for the platform development. Phase 2 would be development, which takes around 4-6 months, where the platform starts to be built including relevant features and is designed with the needs of the target audience in mind. Phase 3, which takes around an additional 2-4 months, happens once the platform is officially developed and would consist of beta testing and feedback where the development team would find users willing to test out the platform and provide feedback. Based on this feedback improvements should be made to the platform. After this phase comes the last phase which would take 6-8 months, which is the actual platform launch where the platform is made public for everyone to use. In this phase marketing and promoting efforts should be made. This platform would be advertised to existing skincare communities and promoted on social media such as Instagram and TikTok where the algorithm would process the data and allow the information to reach the skincare savvy users and make it onto the “skincare side” of TikTok.  This is only a rough timeline and can be altered based on the resources available to the team. 

### Conclusion

#### In conclusion, an open source skincare platform has the ability to completely change how we think about skincare. This open source platform can assist users by facilitating discussions, sharing experiences, and providing personalized recommendations, so in the end users make informed decisions and achieve better skin care outcomes. To achieve these goals, the platform must engage a diverse target audience and provide a range of tools and features that cater to their needs. Working open and building a strong community are also critical to promoting collaboration and fostering a sense of ownership among users. A code of conduct and selecting an appropriate license are crucial elements in making sure the platform is inclusive and sustainable in the long run.  A proposed timeline for the platform's development may include building a minimum viable product, recruiting beta testers, and conducting user research. Future research and development may focus on integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence into skincare recommendations to further improve the platform's effectiveness. Overall, an open source platform dedicated to skincare has the potential to transform the way we think about skincare and empower individuals to take control of their skin.

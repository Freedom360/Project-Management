### Introduction  

[Comment_1]: <> (begin your text here)

This open source community project is regarding an application idea in order to make cooking easy for people who want to get into cooking, or who are already cooking at home but want a more efficient way to cook their food. 
The application consists of several tools. The first one is a tool where a person can 
scan a list of ingredients that a user has and the app will suggest possible food recipes to follow and make using the items on the list or the bill. The second one is a tool which works a very similar way but in a different 
direction. The app can also reccommend what food items or ingredients to buy to make a certain dish or recipe that the user wants to make. So, for example if the user wanted to make an Apple Pie, then they simply can just put 
in Apple Pie in the search bar and pick out their favorite recipe with all the ingredients that they need to make it. This app will also be personalized to the user's preferences and will include accommodations that the user 
needs to adhere to such as dietary restrictions, favorite cuisines, allergies, or any other user preferences and accommodations that they wanted to put in the app before hand so that the app can just filter recipes, ingredients,
and meals that adhere to their preferential needs that they input in the app.

#### Purpose of the Application 

[Comment_5]: <> (begin your text here)

The purpose of this application is to provide a service to people who do a lot of cooking or are trying to do a lot of cooking in general. To add on 
to that, this app idea and development is designed to make life easier for people who want to learn how to cook and who are just getting into cooking. A lot of people who want to get into cooking feel discouraged at the 
beginning because they do not know the ingredients required for certain recipes and ultimately, looking up all of these recipes can take a lot of time, money and effort. A lot of people who are learning how to cook or have 
just started cooking can use this app in order to give them quick and easy recipes to make by just simply scanning a list of ingredients. People who have certain dishes in mind that they want to cook but do not know
the ingredients required or the recipe can just type the dish in the app and it can quickly tell them what ingredients to buy to make this food item. This app is also extremely useful for college students for people 
who are just getting into cooking because it is very cost effective, time effective, and does not take a lot of work to use the app.


#### Target Audience of the Application

[Comment_3]: <> (begin your text here)

The target audience for this application are people who are new to cooking as well as people who cook a lot at home. The reason that this is the target audience is that this application will be useful primarily to these set 
of people. As a college student, after my first year in the dorms, moving to an apartment was a big adjustment and one of the biggest things that I had to get used to was the importance of knowing how to cook. Our budget 
is not that high as college students and we cannot spend that much money every week eating outside or spending all our money on food. Buying groceries or using what we have to make meals in our homes makes our lives a lot easier. 
This is why in particular, I was also trying to reach college students with this app because I firsthand understand the struggles of a college student's food situation when he does not have access to a lot of different resources. 
This app can make the lives of not only college students easier and more convenient but also can make the lives of people in general easier who are trying to get into cooking or even people who are cooking experts because of 
how it can save a lot of money and time going forward. 

#### Benefits of the Application    

[Comment_5]: <> (begin your text here)

There are a number of benefits that are prevalent with users that use this application and some of them are as follows: 

Convenience: These apps aim to make the cooking process more convenient for users. Instead of manually searching for recipes based on the available ingredients, the application will generate recipes that specifically match the 
ingredients users have on hand. This saves time and effort by eliminating the need to browse through multiple recipes or go to the grocery store for missing ingredients. It is also convenient in the other use for the application 
because if one has a recipe that they want to make but do not know what ingredients are needed, the app will extremely conveniently give the ingredients needed for the user to get based on whatever meal, dish or recipe that they
want to make. 

Reduce Food Waste: One of the significant benefits of these apps is their ability to reduce food waste. Many people often have ingredients in their pantry or refrigerator that they need to use before they expire. By 
inputting these ingredients into the app, users can discover recipes that incorporate those ingredients, ensuring that no food goes to waste.

Creativity and Variety: These apps can inspire creativity in the kitchen by suggesting new and unique recipes based on the available ingredients. Users may discover innovative ways to use familiar ingredients or experiment 
with new combinations. It encourages culinary exploration and helps users break out of their cooking routines.

Budget-Friendly: Cooking from ingredients already in the pantry can be more cost-effective than buying additional ingredients. These apps can suggest recipes that make the most of what users have, potentially saving them money
by avoiding unnecessary purchases.

Dietary Preferences and Restrictions: Many of these apps allow users to set dietary preferences or restrictions, such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or dairy-free. The app's recipe generation algorithm takes these 
preferences into account, ensuring that the suggested recipes align with the user's dietary needs.

Overall, these apps simplify the cooking process, promote resourcefulness in the kitchen, and encourage users to make the most of the ingredients they already have.

#### Application Creation Process

[Comment_5]: <> (begin your text here)

Creating the application will require several steps and the process will take some time, but here is a general outline as to how what exactly I need to do to make sure that the application creation process will work: 

Define the App Idea and Purpose:

Determine the main purpose and functionality of the app.
Identify a target audience and their needs.
Conduct market research to assess the viability and potential demand for the app.

Plan the App:

Create a detailed app concept and define its features and functionalities.
Design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for the app.
Develop a wireframe or prototype to visualize the app's structure and flow.

Identify the Platform:

Decide whether I want to develop your app for iOS, Android, or both.
Consider the pros and cons of each platform, as well as ,y target audience's preferences.

Backend Development:

Determine the server requirements and select a suitable backend technology stack.
Develop the necessary server side infrastructure for data storage, user authentication, and other backend functionalities.

Frontend Development:

Choose the appropriate programming languages and frameworks for the frontend development.
Develop the user interface (UI) of the app, ensuring it aligns with the wireframes or prototypes created earlier.

App Development:

Depending on the chosen platform, use the respective programming languages and frameworks (for example, Swift and Xcode for iOS, Java or Kotlin and Android Studio for Android) to develop the app's functionality.
Implement the planned features and integrate the backend APIs into the app.

Testing and Debugging:

Conduct thorough testing of the app to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
Perform functional testing, usability testing, and compatibility testing across different devices and operating systems.

Gather user feedback and reviews to improve the app and enhance user satisfaction.

Maintenance and Updates:

Continuously monitor the app's performance and user feedback.
Release regular updates to fix bugs, introduce new features, and ensure compatibility with the latest operating systems and devices.

#### The Use of Open Source for this Project

[Comment_5]: <> (begin your text here)

There are a lot of benefits to using open source with this project and many of them are as follows:  

Many people can work on designing and implementing the app at the same time:
Open source allows there to be many users who are working together to develop this app at the same time which makes it extremely easy, convenient, and expeditious to create this app

Others can use this app to create their own version of this app: 
The app that is created with the use of open source for this particular topic can be replicated or used as a base line by other app developers who want to create similar apps or apps that have a smilar purpose to this one

Very cost effective:
The use of open source in this project can help save a lot of money and time with the creation of this app

Faster, More-Transparent Development: 
Closed-source software can often be a black box that neither developers nor business users (who aren’t programmers themselves) can’t meaningfully alter or enhance. As a result, when you experience challenges, 
you’ll need to partner with vendor support agents or just wait until the vendor builds a solution to your problem. Open-source projects give you full visibility into the code base, which means you can frequently code your 
solutions and directly document your issues in community spaces. And you may receive a variety of responses that provide as much or more context as you’d receive from a professional support team, as fast or faster (Park 2022).

Absolute transparency and flexibility as the software can be used in any way in an open source community: 
The transparency and flexbility that comes with more people working on the project in an open source community cannot be stated enough and is a big reason why open source is very useful for this app and for this project's 
development. 

More Employment Opportunities: 
Some of the most widely used technical tools and operating systems on the market today are open source: the Linux operating system, the Kubernetes container platform, the Django Python framework, and many others. 
Developers that are familiar with popular open-source tools and are passionate enough to contribute to them can find it easier to locate new job opportunities with employers that recognize such valuable skills (Park 2022).

In order to use open source to our fullest we have to be able to figure out the most structured and effective method to implement open source in our project. In Professor Bradly Alicea's lessons we were able to learn a couple
of approaches in order to use open source for a project and the steps are as follows: 

There are 6 questions that we have to ask ourselves in order to build the most effective open source implementation for our project 

- What is the purpose? 
- How should members behave? 
- How to determine the state of the community?
- What communities are similar to mine?
- What is our high level engagement plan?
- How do we maintain consistency and evangelism with this project?

I also suggest the implementation and the use of the waterfall approach which maps out a project into distinct, sequential phases, with each new phase beginning only when the previous one has been completed. 
The Waterfall system is the most traditional method for managing a project, with team members working linearly towards a set end goal. Each participant has a clearly defined role, and none of the phases or goals are expected 
to change (Wrike 2023).

As can be seen by the above image, these are the 5 steps required to implement the waterfall approach in this open source project. It is extremely easy to follow and can be carried out very conveniently and effectively for 
the purpose of this app. 


### Conclusion      

[Comment_7]: <> (begin your text here)

To conclude, the project that I am suggesting is extremely useful because it allows people who are getting into cooking, or who are advanced cooks or chefs who cook a lot to be able to cook extremely conveniently. An app
that allows users to input whatever ingredients that they have at home or that they are trying to buy at the grocery store and which can return which meals or recipes that they can make based on those ingredients. Overall, an 
app that generates recipes based on available ingredients as well as generates a list of ingredients needed to make certain recipes streamlines the cooking experience, reduces food waste, fosters creativity, and 
accommodates individual dietary requirements, making it a valuable tool for home cooks seeking convenience and inspiration in the kitchen.
There are a number of different aspects that open source management can help with as far as this project idea is concerned. An app to make cooking easier for a lot of different people around the world and more
money and time saving is needed and this app that I am suggesting can do those things while also being developed in an efficient and effective manner. The steps that I have to take to carry out a proper open source project
for this particular topic would be to define the project scope, select an open source license, set Up version control and repository, design the app architecture, develop the core functionality, 
create a contributor community, test and refine, document and provide User Support, release and distribution, as well as maintain and grow the project. By following these steps, I can create an open source project that 
enables users to cook easier by generating recipes from available ingredients as well as figuring out what to buy based on recipes inputted by the user 
while fostering a collaborative community around the app's development and improvement.

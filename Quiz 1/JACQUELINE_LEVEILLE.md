My name is Jacqueline Leveille!
<br> Here are some cool stylistic elements I can do:

- <ins>underlines<ins/>
- **bold**
- *italics*
- ~slashes~
- <mark>highlights</mark>
- <a href="https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/32848" target="_blank">Link to Class Canvas Page</a>
- Cool symbols (&copy;,&reg;,&trade;,&#176;,&uarr;)
- Greek letters ($/A$, $\Phi$, $\Omega$

>### I can also add blockquotes with a numbered list.
> 1. Wake up
> 2. Use restroom
> 3. Brush teeth
> 4. Get dressed
> 5. Eat breakfast
> 6. Have a great day!
  
### There is also ways to format your text.
<br><p align="center"> This text is centered </p>
<br>&nbsp;There is an indent before this line.

### I can also make tables.
| Fruits      |Vegetables|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Apple      |Carrot |
| Orange   |Broccoli |
| Grape   | Lettuce |

#### Here is a picture of some fruits and vegetables.

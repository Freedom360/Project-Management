I thought it might be fun to theme this assignment on the upcoming holiday: Valentine's Day! 
To start, some headings of different sizes:
# Valentine's Day
## A day to appreciate your partner and/or loved ones!
### This year falling on Tuesday, February 14th, 2023

Now, a list of things you might need for the holiday!
1. Candy/Chocolate
2. Flowers
3. Candles
4. Gift :)

<H3> Lastly, a photo in theme of the upcoming Valentine's Day </H3>

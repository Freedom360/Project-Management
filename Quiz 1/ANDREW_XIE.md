Not quite sure of what to write, so I'll just use markdown elements.
# This is a header.
## Most of my previous documentation writing in markdown uses a lot of headers and horizontal lines, like the one below.

I'm currently looking at a Github markdown cheatsheet as a syntax reference, and here's their logo:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Here's also a table, because why not:
| Tables        | Goes          | Here  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Element 1     | Something     | Words |
| Element 2     | More stuff    | Words |
| Element 3     | Tables and words      | Words |

Now, I'm not sure if that all counts as one stylistic element, so I'll now look at the slides and add some stuff from those.
To be quite honest, I don't really want to find a csv file for this assignment specifically, so I'll do some other things.

<H1> Maybe a HTML header </H1>

Numbered lists are also nice
1. First
2. Second
3. Third


I do think that's enough since the prompt asked for at least three elements and I have
* Headers
* Headers but HTML
* Image insert
* Horizontal line
* Table
* Numbered list
* Bullet list

That's a bit more than 3, hopefully I interpreted the prompt correctly and that's sufficient.

### Course Objectives
In this course, students will learn how to manage projects using open-source principles and tools, as well as how to manage distributed collaborations. These skills include learning how to work with version-control systems, managing projects according to the principles of “working open”, and managing distributed and asynchronous communities. Open-source techniques provide small projects with bureaucratic flexibility and access to collaborators from around the world. Managing the open-source way, particularly through the use of open-source communities, is growing in popularity among large corporations and startups alike. 

Learning will be assessed through two quizzes to foster understanding. The lessons learned here are transferable to a wide range of project types. Students will also apply the skills learned in the course to a paper describing a hypothetical but personally-relevant open-source project. This paper will realize many of the techniques and ideas covered in this curriculum. For students specializing in library science, you may also take the paper assignment as an opportunity to apply your newly acquired version-control skills to a problem in the field.
